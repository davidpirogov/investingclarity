# Passive ETF Investment

The intent of this document is to be applicable to the general public who want to invest without worrying about learning the depths and intricacies of the financial markets.

This document outlines ideas for consideration. Please ensure to read the [Important Notice](#important-notice) at the bottom of this document. It is assumed the reader is familiar with the basics of [portfolio management](https://www.investopedia.com/portfolio-management-4689745) and [ETFs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp).

This document does not explore fixed-income ETFs as the strategies described in this document are optimised for long-term wealth creation, not income generation.

When sailing in a boat, the skipper adjusts the sails to the direction of the wind. Similarly, the process of rebalancing adjusts the portfolio to the economic conditions. For those who don't want to closely monitor their portfolio, there should be a quick check at least every 3 months to ensure the level of risk is acceptable.

**NOTE:** All equities (stocks, ETFs) are risky. The level of risk, volatility, and opportunity typically go hand in hand, which means that higher risk ETFs can go up and go down, they also tend to move more, and provide more opportunity for upside *and* downside. 

Any investor should consider their objectives. Here are two considerations (out of many) that are examples of objectives: 
* Wealth creation typically requires higher risk assets to be able to capture opportunity and volatility. However, there are periods of time (1930s, 1970s) when the market falls and does not recover for more than 10+ years. People approaching retirement probably do not want to lose their retirement funds to long market cycles.
* While most ETF investments carry relatively lower risk of catastrophic loss (i.e., the value of the investment going to zero), it is still important to only invest discretionary money. Put simply, do not invest money that has to go to pay bills, rent, etc. Markets go up and down. 

## Common Terminology

This section is a refresher to help with the subsequent sections.

An **investment strategy** is an approach that can be easily explained. It should be consistent, repeatable, and profitable.

There are three strategies described in this document.

The process of passive investing in ETFs can be referred to as [Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp).

For example, a small proportion (e.g. 10% - 15%) of every pay could be automatically deposited in a brokerage and every month an amount of ETFs purchased with that money.

All strategies in this document have several similar ETFs. The important consideration is Assets Under Management (AUM) and Expense Ratio.

-   Higher AUM generally means a successful fund that has more capital to deploy when working with large-cap assets.
-   Higher Expense ratio means less return to the investor of that ETF.

From the set of similar ETFs, every investor should consider the *highest AUM* and *lowest Expense Ratio* ETF that matches their investment objectives.

When macroeconomic factors affect the broad market, terminology such as "risk on" (investors taking on more risk by buying risky assets) or "risk off" (investors shedding risk by selling risky assets) is important to understand when engaging in more complex strategies.

For example, with a $500 monthly deposit and taking the DCA approach, an investor could think about purchasing up to $500 worth of stocks, leaving the remainder as cash for next month's purchases:

-   4x `VT` ($112.77 each) for $451.08
-   Leave $48.92 as cash for next month's purchase

This approach means that over a long period of time (3+ years), the number of stocks a portfolio owns will increase. Rebalancing is important to ensure the optimal ETFs are being held. 

ETFs change over time and it is not recommended to become attached to any one ETF. It's best to allocate money to ETFs that are most profitable.

### Commissions and Fees

All amounts in this document *do not include* commissions and fees typically charged by brokers. Some brokers, especially ones provided by major banks, charge very high fees in return for simple websites and user interfaces. Other brokers charge lower fees but may require the installation of their software to use their services.

For occassional trades, e.g. once a year, it may be worthwhile to use a major bank brokerage; however, when trading more often (e.g. buying monthly as described in this document), brokerage fees can often cannibalise the portfolio. 

Consider commissions and fees very carefully when choosing a broker.

## Passive: Total Market Strategy

### Investment Objective

Purchase shares of one or two total market ETFs.

### Thesis

Human industry, hard work, growing population, improved technology, orderly central banks, and favourable government policies contribute to secular improvements in global or regional economies.

A total market ETF owns a little bit of almost all the companies in a particular market, meaning that it is a good representation of the average economy. Owning a shares in a total market ETF also lowers the risk of catastrophic loss (value of investment going to zero) while providing upside due to people's hard work, industry, and ingenuity. 

### Portfolio

-   100% invested in a single ETF, examples in this document are chosen from the [list below](#etfs)

For example, with a $500 monthly deposit, an investor could think about purchasing 8x shares of `SPGM` ($60.88 each) for a total of $487.04. Then, the $12.96 remainder is left for next month. When the next month's deposit of $500 is made, there is a total of $512.96 ($500 + $12.96 from the previous month) to spend for that month.

This portfolio time horizon is between 12 to 24 months between rebalancing between ETFs. 

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Semi-passive: US and Global Market Strategy

### Investment Objective

Purchase a proportion of a US market ETF and a Global market ETF. Typically a 60-40 split is used, such that:

-   Risk on: *about* 60% US and 40% Global
-   Risk off: *about* 40% US and 60% Global

### Thesis

The United States is unique with a mostly unrestrained free-market capitalist approach to markets. As the [World Reserve Currency (WRC)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reservecurrency.asp), the US Federal Reserve and the US Government are able to export a lot of inflation to the rest of the world while preserving the stability of their own markets. Given its WRC status, equities denoted in the US dollar are able to return higher growth on invested capital than other parts of the world.

During periods of Quantitative Easing (QE) combined with access to the cheapest credit on the planet, the US markets experience periods of outsized growth that are unmatched by the rest of the world. The US market is also unique by having pension funds, mutual funds, 401(k) and similar funds providing a steady demand by having to buy stocks every quarter. Similarly, in Australia, superannuation funds who invest in stock markets provide a consistent upward pressure on stock prices by purchasing stocks.

In order to capture wealth creation opportunities, this strategy approach is to construct a portfolio that has limited exposure to both US markets and Global markets.

### Portfolio

During periods of growth, such as QE, a 'risk on' portfolio means that more capital is allocated to higher risk markets in search of higher returns. Vice versa for periods of 'risk off'.

When the US or Global markets experiences periods of turbulence, a rebalance is required to move the portfolio from 'risk on' to 'risk off' state. This is achieved by selling a proportion of US market ETFs (this is called *cash extraction*) and, with the proceeds, purchasing a global market ETF.

This portfolio time horizon is 6 months to 12 months for rebalancing between ETFs.

| Risk on                             | Risk off                            |
| :---------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| US market ETF: 60% of porfolio      | US market ETF: 40% of porfolio      |
| Global market ETF: 40% of portfolio | Global market ETF: 60% of portfolio |

For example, with a $500 monthly deposit, an investor could think about purchasing ETFs like this:

| Risk on                         | Risk off                       |
| :------------------------------ | :----------------------------- |
| 6x shares of `SPLG` for $384.48 | 2x share of `SPLG` for $128.16 |
| 1x share of `VT` for $112.77    | 2x share of `VT` for $338.31   |
| Leave $2.75 for next month      | Leave $33.53 for next month    |

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Sector-weighted: Ethical, ESG, or Asset class-specific Strategy

### Investment Objective

Purchase shares in three ETFs that represent a diversified balance between total market and a sector or asset class of interest. This approach is higher risk and requires constant attention to the portfolio and the prices of the invested ETFs. 

The **most important** point with this approach is that it doesn't matter what an investor believes is right, equitable, morally just, future-proof, etc. If the stock market doesn't like the ETF because it doesn't give a good return, then the prices of that ETF will drop and hence the value of the investor's portfolio will fall. 

For example, if the stock market thinks that ESG initiatives are no longer a profitable goal, then any ESG-focused ETF will experience a dramatic decline. This is not a reflection of whether or not ESG worthwhile, rather it's a reflection that the stock market can't make as much money from it as it can investing in other stocks.

This strategy could be achieved with the following portfolio splits:

-   30% of portfolio in a Global market ETF
-   30% and 40% of portfolio in Sector or Regional ETFs

### Thesis

Building on the diversified base of a Global market ETF, an assumption is made that some sectors may outperform in the next long-term infrastructure investment cycle (5+ years).

Major societal changes as the Boomer generation retires & Millenials become the largest population cohort, climate change begins to affect food production and living conditions, technological progress with 'green technology', commercialized space-based industry grows, there are ETFs that track supply chains and sectors that have a high level of governmental policy tail-winds, outsized funding by large asset managers (e.g. BlackRock), provide ample opportunities to generate wealth.

### Portfolio

Whether the global economy is going through periods of growth or balance, this portfolio structure has a long term, at least 5+ year view of what is going to be important in the future. It's a high-risk bet on what society will find important in over five years time.

A typical portfolio will allocate:

-   30% in a Global market ETF
-   30% and 40% in a Sector or Regional ETF

This portfolio time horizon is between 12 months to 36 months to rebalance between ETFs.
